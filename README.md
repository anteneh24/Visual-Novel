# AI Visual Novel

This project is an AI-driven visual novel generator that dynamically creates text-based narratives and AI-generated images for an interactive storytelling experience.

## Features
- **AI-Generated Story**: Uses an AI model to generate interactive narratives based on user input.
- **AI-Generated Images**: Dynamically generates background and character images using AI.
- **React & Next.js**: Built with a modern frontend framework for a seamless user experience.
- **Framer Motion**: Adds smooth animations to enhance the storytelling.
- **REST API Integration**: Fetches generated content from an AI-powered backend.

## Scaling Up
This project can be scaled up with the following enhancements:

### 1. **API Gateway**
Implementing an API Gateway will:
- Improve security by preventing unauthorized access.
- Enable rate-limiting to prevent abuse.
- Manage authentication and user roles efficiently.

### 2. **Persistent Storage**
Currently, generated images and text are used in real-time. To improve performance and provide historical access, we can:
- Save generated images and text in a database or cloud storage.
- Enable users to revisit previous story paths.

### 3. **AI Model Optimization & Fine-Tuning**
To improve content generation quality:
- Store generated data and use it to fine-tune an AI model for better consistency.
- Integrate other free AI models for enhanced text and image generation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anteneh24/Visual-Novel.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Ensure backend API endpoints are running locally at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Future Improvements
- User authentication and profiles.
- Story saving and branching.
- Multiplayer or collaborative storytelling.
